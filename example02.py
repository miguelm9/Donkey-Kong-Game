# calculations needed each frame, the other will paint things on the screen
# They can have any name, but the 'standard' ones are update and draw

    Escape key or Q are pressed to finish the program'''

    # For a circle: circ(x: int, y: int, r: int, col: int)
    pyxel.circ(50, 80, 10, 6)
    # For a circle 'frame'
